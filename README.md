# Pokedex

A Pokedex inspired, HTML / CSS / JavaScript styling practice project using a cloned sprite repository found [*here*](https://github.com/PokeAPI/sprites.git).

## Description

This app was primarily made to practice cloning a repository and working with open source Github projects. The project is based upon the github Pok√©API sprite project and prints out the pokemon for each region as well as it's pokedex number. 

### Key Functionality:
- Print all pokemon from a given region
- See designated sprite photos and numbers
- List and filter by region or print all pokemon.
## Demo - check it out [*here*](https://resonant-pony-4d0ebe.netlify.app/)

## Roadmap - (Goals and ToDos)

- The ability to search by name / pokemon number would be a cool extra feature.
- Making the app look more like a pokedex with general pokedex usability would be nice.
- There are some sizing problems with the main pokedex screen that prints all of the pokemon.

## My Design Process

The general design is based upon the original red pokedex. The screen is meant to have a green text hue to it remeniscent of old style computers. The scroll bar itself has also been colored to match this. The test Gotta Catch em' All is the general tag-line of pokemon and uses a Pokemon-esque font to tie it all in.
